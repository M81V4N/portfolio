# scrapyard
The results of messing around with Python.
(small note: In case you SOMEHOW would like to use my crappy code, feel free to do it. Just put my nick in the credits.)

## consoleGames
### BATTLE.CO_infinite
unfinished text-based rpg game project. 3 heroes facing randomly-generated monsters every day.
### one.py
UNO-like game, project seased.

-----
## fileOperations
### DataManagingScript
"Database" tests. Write prompts to console to modify data.py. Yes, I know it's dumb to use .py file to store data. But it works. And I'm too lazy to modify this.
