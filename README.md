# scrapyard
The results of messing around with Python. Tests, smaller projects, silly ideas.
(small note: In case you would like to *for some reason*  use my crappy code, feel free to do it. Just put my nick in the credits.)

-----
## [consoleGames](consoleGames)
### BATTLE.CO_infinite
unfinished text-based rpg game project. 3 heroes facing randomly-generated monsters every day. Old script, repeatable copy-pasted lines... not worth checking out

-----
## [fileOperations](fileOperations)
### DataManagingScript
"Database" tests. Write prompts to console to modify data.py. Also, a test for importing other python files

-----
## [math](math)
### DividingDividers
Lists all dividers of a number. Highly uneffective, has problems with any number that is longer than 7 digits. But it works.
### NumberGrater
Search for prime dividers. Just like in elementary school.
### PascalBracket
TO BE FIXED. i was making it before I had this on the math lesson, so I totally had no clue what's it supposed to do. TO BE REWRITTEN
### PascalResearcher
Basically searches for next rows of the Pascal pyramid. Endlessly. Used in the script above.
### SanicPrimes
Third version of my primes searching script.

-----
## [sillyStuff](sillyStuff)
### FizzBuzz
Nothing special. My take on a simple script that apparently is a part of recruitment process for some companies.
### OKinator
basically replaces all letters in the input with respective amount of "ok" for the position in the alphabet of said key. Example of use is in the out.txt file. Try to guess what was this file previously!
### PokeScam
Macro that switches between two accounts on Discord and constantly runs Pokecord duel commands to gain XP. In order to make it work, immediately after starting script press the text box in first window, then press the second textbox in the second window. I recommend having all three windows: browser, console and discord app next to each other. Stop the script by holding (CTRL). also close all windows besides those required just in case something goes wrong
### SuperPowerRandomiser
Ever wanted to become a superhero? Now it's a dream come true with paranormal abilities, pasionately designed by Redditors! Get random powers from subreddits of your choice, by utilising PRAW library. Remember to create an app on webside to which link is provided in the code, and fill out the detais in the 9th line!

-----
## [utils](utils)
### Alarm
Simple alarm with TTS message activacting on specified time. It works on macOS, not so sure about Linux or Windows
### Brute1V4N
More of a silly idea, it's supposed to generate all possible combinations with letters up to 20 character string. And yes, I could make one loop for going after every character in the password! It was just a long time ago.
### caesar
The most basic script there is, with a very obvious twist. it just plays around with Caesar ciphers. If you don't know the "key", just use its' bruteforcing function!
### SummoningStone
Tired of copy-pasting pings to make your friends come on voice chat? Why not automate this process! This simple discord bot will constantly ping your target. Friendly disclaimer: they *might* get mad at you for using it
### Timer
Alarm, but activates after specified amount of seconds.
