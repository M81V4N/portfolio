# scrapyard
The results of messing around with Python.
(small note: In case you SOMEHOW would like to use my crappy code, feel free to do it. Just put my nick in the credits.)

-----
## consoleGames
### BATTLE.CO_infinite
unfinished text-based rpg game project. 3 heroes facing randomly-generated monsters every day.
### one.py
UNO-like game, project seased.

-----
## fileOperations
### DataManagingScript
"Database" tests. Write prompts to console to modify data.py. Yes, I know it's dumb to use .py file to store data. But it works. And I'm too lazy to modify this.

-----
## math
### DividingDividers
Lists all dividers of a number. Highly uneffective, has problems with any number that is longer than 7 numbers. But it works.
### NumberGrater
Search for prime dividers. Just like in elementary school.
### PascalBracket
PLEASE IGNORE. i was making it before I had this on the math lesson, so I totally had no clue what's it supposed to do. TO BE REWRITTEN
### PascalResearcher
Basically searches for next rows of the Pascal pyramid. Endlessly. Used in the script above.
### SanicPrimes
Third version of my primes searching script.

-----
## sillyStuff
### OKinator
basically replaces all letters in the input with respective amount of "ok" for the position in the alphabet of said key. Example of use is in the out.txt file. Try to guess what was this file previously!

-----
## utils
### Alarm
Simple alarm with TTS message activacting on specified time. It works on macOS, not so sure about Linux or Windows
### Brute1V4N
More of a silly idea, it's supposed to generate all possible combinations with letters up to 20 character string.
### Timer.py
Alarm, but activates after specified amount of seconds.
